	abstract = {An explanation of the observed light distributions of elliptical galaxies is sought and found. The violently changing gravitational field of a newly formed galaxy is effective in changing the statistics of stellar orbits. The equilibrium distribution under this encounterless relaxation is found by use of a fourth type of statistics related to both Fermi-Dirac statistics and equipartition of energy per unit mass. In the relevant limit this becomes Maxwell's distribution but with temperature proportional to mass. The predicted light distributions are those of the modified isothermal spheres developed by Michie from considerations of stellar relaxation in globular clusters. Both these and the special case further developed by King are known to give agreement with observations of spherical systems. Application to clusters of galaxies will remove Zwicky's paradox. The theory is also developed for rotating systems where allowance must be made for anisotropy of stellar motions of the outer parts are not to be much flatter than the inner parts. The new statistics developed here should have important applications to collisionless plasmas and collisionless shocks. Kelvin's theorem is rederived for collisionless dynamics. It is suggested that the typical `equilibrium' state of a stellar system may be hierarchical.},

First, an exact spherical distribution function for the spheroids (halo and bulge) is determined, such that it is in equilibrium with the gravitational monopole of the disc components. Second, an N-body realization of this model is adapted to the full disc potential by growing the latter adiabatically from its monopole. Finally, the disc is sampled with particles drawn from an appropriate distribution function, avoiding local-Maxwellian approximations. We performed test simulations and find that the halo and bulge radial density profile very closely match their target model, while they become slightly oblate due to the added disc gravity. Our findings suggest that vertical thickening of the initially thin disc is caused predominantly by spiral and bar instabilities, which also result in a radial re-distribution of matter, rather than scattering off interloping massive halo particles.},

We also determine a probability density function on the properties of the model, which demonstrates that the mass distribution of the Galaxy remains very uncertain. For our choices of parametrization and constraints, we find disc scalelengths of 3.00 ± 0.22 and 3.29 ± 0.56 kpc for the thin and thick discs, respectively, a solar radius of 8.29 ± 0.16 kpc and a circular speed at the Sun of 239 ± 5 km s−1, a total stellar mass of 6.43 ± 0.63 × 1010 M⊙, a virial mass of 1.26 ± 0.24 × 1012 M⊙ and a local dark matter density of 0.40 ± 0.04 GeV cm−3.

The evolution of such systems and possible relaxation effects are investigated in detail.Slow hyperbolic encounters between exponential disc-type galaxies give rise to strong tidal effects. These lead to asymmetric mass exchange, energy change and angular momentum loss. Resonances between particles and the relative orbit depending on the orientation of the three spins involved determine the strength of the interaction. Only a few per cent of the particles escape, but they carry away a substantial fraction of the angular momentum. Generally, the galaxy spins decrease and the disc and halo angular momentum vectors are not aligned after an encounter. The response of a galaxy to a collision with another galaxy is considerably different from that caused by a single perturber.Merger cross-sections are spin-dependent. In the present experiments, the remnants have distinct visible cores and Hubble-type density profiles. They are triaxial, rotate slowly, and have anisotropic velocity structures.

	abstract = {This paper considers the question of the large-scale gravitational stability of an arbitrary, highly flattened stellar system, which is assumed initially to rotate in approximate equilibrium between its self-gravitation and the centrifugal forces. It is concluded that no such disk, if fairly smooth or uniform, can be entirely stable against a tendency to form massive condensations within its own plane, unless the root-mean-square random velocities of its constituents, in the directions parallel to that plane, are everywhere sufficiently large. Lacking such random motions, it is shown that the system must be vulnerable to numerous unstable disturbances, the dimensions of which may approach its over-all radius, and whose times of growth are to be reckoned in fractions of the typical periods of revolution. The minimum root-mean-square radial velocity dispersion required in any one vicinity for the complete suppression of all axisymmetric instabilities is calculated (in collaboration with A. Kalnajs) as 3.36 G /K, where G is the gravitational constant, and and K are the local values of the projected stellar density and the epicyclic frequency, respectively. From that, and the observed j\# and K, together with their uncertainties, this minimum for the solar neighborhood of our Galaxy is estimated to fall between 20 and 35 k /sec, a range which indeed encompasses the actual radial velocity dispersions of the most predominant types of stars in our vicinity. It is pointed out that both this curious agreement, and also the well-known discrepancy between the z- and r-velocity dispersions at least of the older disk stars, may be explainable in terms of past instabilities of this galactic disk.},

	abstract = {In astrophysics, Toomre's stability criterion (also known as the Safronov–Toomre criterion) is a relationship between parameters of a differentially rotating, gaseous accretion disc which can be used to determine approximately whether the system is stable.  In the case of a stationary gas, the Jeans stability criterion can be used to compare the strength of gravity with that of thermal pressure.  In the case of a differentially rotating disk, the shear force can provide an additional stabilizing force.
The Toomre criterion for a disk to be stable can be expressed as,

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}Sigma \}
   is the surface density of the disk.The Toomre Q parameter is often defined as the left-hand side of Eq.1,

The stability criterion can then simply be stated as,

The previous discussion was for a gaseous disk, but a similar analysis can be applied to a disk of stars (for example, the disk of a galaxy), yielding a kinematic Q parameter,

This imposes constraints on the dynamical and kinematic parameters of the main subsystems (the disk, bulge, and halo). The disk surface density in the solar neighborhood should not exceed 58 M / pc2. Further, we ﬁnd that the observed local decrease in the rotational velocity at 6 kpc r 10 kpc is not associated with details of the radial distribution of matter in the Galaxy and instead results from dynamical processes or some other factors responsible for noncircular motions. It follows from the presence of a long-lived bar and the observed distribution of the stellar-velocity dispersion that the central maximum in the rotation curve at radius r 300 pc cannot be associated with a very concentrated bulge core. The best agreement between the observational data and the parameters of the dynamical models is achieved for a radial disk scale length of L 3 kpc.

Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.},

However, the present review concentrates on the results already obtained in the n-body simulations using systems containing up to 200000 simulation stars. Results are presented which show that the stability criterion developed for flattened systems applies only to truly axisymmetric instabilities. Purely stellar disks acquire rather large velocity dispersions, generally two or more times the velocity dispersion required by Toomre for axisymmetric stability. In the computer simulations, the bar-forming instability can be prevented only by comparatively large velocity dispersions. However, simulations inclusing the effects of the galactic halo and core as a fixed background field show that bar formation can be prevented for fixed halo components as large or larger than the self-consistent disk component. Experiments performed to determine the collisional relaxation time for the large-scale gravitational n-body calculations show that these models are indeed ‘collisionless’.},

	abstract = {We model the dynamics of gas in a merger of two disk/halo galaxies of equal mass using a hybrid iV-body/ gasdynamics code. Violent tidal forces acting on the disks draw out extended tails and trigger the formation of central bars. As such bars form, gas in the inner half of each disk loses most of its angular momentum through gravitational torques and falls into a compact cloud within the center of the galaxy. These nuclear gas clouds merge when their parent galaxies do, resulting in the rapid assembly of {\textasciitilde}5 x 109 M0 of gas, which may plausibly be identified with the large central clouds seen in CO observations of galaxies such as NGC 520. Violent star formation in such central gas clouds, which seems inevitable, offers a likely explanation for luminous IRAS galaxies and may contribute significantly to the central stellar populations of merger remnants. If some of the nuclear gas can continue to lose angular momentum, it may be able to fuel or even form a central black hole, resulting in a radio galaxy or possibly even a quasar.},

The principal problem is still to determine to what extent the dark matter is important in the inner parts of a galaxy, or in other words, how dominant is the self-gravitation of the disc. Studies of the shapes of rotation curves show that in detail there is sufficient individuality in spiral galaxies to prohibit the construction of ``Universal Rotation Curves''. A detailed account is given of the method of Athanassoula et al. (1987), where swing amplifier criteria are applied to set a range in the mass-to-light ratio of the disc. To restrict this range further, other methods might be useful. For a number of bright spirals the rotation curve drops just outside the optical image, but this feature by itself cannot constrain unambiguously the mass models. The use of velocity dispersions seems a promising way, though the observational problems are hard. Within the uncertainties, discs can be close to ``maximum'', even though a range of values cannot be excluded.},

By combining photometric and astrometric information from the Two Micron All Sky Survey and Gaia survey, the precise distances of the sample stars are determined by a supervised machine-learning algorithm: the gradient-boosted decision trees. To test the accuracy of the derived distances, member stars of globular clusters (GCs) and open clusters are used. The tests by cluster member stars show a precision of about 10\% with negligible zero-point offsets, for the derived distances of our sample stars. The final sample covers a large volume of the Galactic disk(s) and halo of 0 {\textless} R {\textless} 30 kpc and ∣Z∣ ≤ 15 kpc. The rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way across the radius of 5 ≲ R ≲ 25 kpc has been accurately measured with {\textasciitilde}54,000 stars of the thin disk population selected from the LRGB sample. The derived RC shows a weak decline along R with a gradient of -1.83 ± 0.02 (stat.) ± 0.07 (sys.) km s-1 kpc-1, in excellent agreement with the results measured by previous studies. The circular velocity at the solar position, yielded by our RC is 234.04 ± 0.08 (stat.) ± 1.36 (sys.) km s-1, again in great consistency with other independent determinations. From the newly constructed RC, as well as constraints from other data, we have constructed a mass model for our Galaxy, yielding a mass of the dark matter halo of M 200 = (8.05 ± 1.15) × 1011 M ⊙ with a corresponding radius of R 200 = 192.37 ± 9.24 kpc and a local dark matter density of 0.39 ± 0.03 GeV cm-3.},

These baryon models are combined with one of the four dark matter profiles: Burkert profile, core-modified profile, pseudo-isothermal profile and NFW profile, to fit the observed rotation curve data. Results show that in general the NFW profile fits the data better than the Burkert profile, while the core-modified profile and the pseudo-isothermal profile are essentially ruled out.

The method used to create these models is that demonstrated in our previous study, and we improve on those models by adding gas discs to the potential, considering the effects of allowing the inner slope of the halo density profile to vary, and including new observations of maser sources in the Milky Way amongst the new constraints. We provide a best-fitting model, as well as estimates of the properties of the Milky Way. Under the assumptions in our main model, we find that the Sun is R0 = 8.20 ± 0.09 kpc from the Galactic Centre, with the circular speed at the Sun being v0 = 232.8 ± 3.0 km s−1; and that the Galaxy has a total stellar mass of (54.3 ± 5.7) × 109  M⊙, a total virial mass of (1.30 ± 0.30) × 1012 M⊙ and a local dark-matter density of 0.40 ± 0.04 GeV cm−3, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical. These values are sensitive to our choice of priors and constraints. We investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may be larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on R0, we find it to be 7.97 ± 0.15 kpc and that v0 = 226.8 ± 4.2 km s−1. We find that most of these properties, including the local dark-matter density, are remarkably insensitive to the assumed power-law density slope at the centre of the dark-matter halo. We find that it is unlikely that the local standard of rest differs significantly from that found under assumptions of axisymmetry. We have made code to compute the force from our potential, and to integrate orbits within it, publicly available.},

	abstract = {Using N-body experiments we investigate the global stability of a series of models designed to match the observed photometric and kinematic properties of disc galaxies. The models, therefore, have an exponential surface density profile and rotation curves which are flat at large radii. We find a simple delineator of stability to bar-like modes for a cold disc: \$\{{\textbackslash}upsilon \}\_\{m\}/({\textbackslash}alpha \{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{D\}G){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}=1.1,{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{where\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}upsilon \}\_\{m\}\$ is the maximum rotational velocity, \$\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ is the scale length of the exponential disc and MD is the total disc mass. This is to be compared to a self-gravitating exponential disc for which \$\{{\textbackslash}upsilon \}\_{\textbackslash}text\{m\}/({\textbackslash}alpha \{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{D\}G){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}=0.63\$, thus a hot ‘halo’ component is required to increase this ratio in a cool disc and provide stability to bar formation. This criterion has been found to apply independent of the concentration of the halo (bulge) component. In addition, the results appear to be insensitive to a substantial increase in random motions in the central part of the disc and also to changes in the shape of the rotation curve or the adopted surface density profile. The results from the models are compared with available photometric and kinematic data of disc galaxies and are used to set limits on the mass-to-light ratio of the disc component. In particular we find that the cool disc component of unbarred Sc galaxies must have \$\{(M/L)\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{D\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}lesssim{\textbackslash},1.5{\textbackslash},\{h\}\$ (where h is Hubble's constant in units of \$100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{km\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) compared with a total mass-to-light ratio interior to the Holmberg radius of ≈ 8 h, derived from their rotation curves. Normalizing the stellar population models of Larson \&amp; Tinsley (1978) and Tinsley (1981) to the results for Sc galaxies and data in the solar neighbourhood, we find that the later- type galaxies (Sd–Sm) may have a total H I mass comparable to or exceeding the mass in disc stars. The population models also predict lower masses for the disc components of early-type disc galaxies than those deduced from their rotation curves suggesting that they possess enough dark matter to stabilize their discs.},

Relaxation is an important but controllable problem for N-body simulation of disks, and some of the confusion about the criteria for global stability of disks may have resulted from spurious results caused by relaxation.

Our simulated galaxies are not in the ideal state assumed in Toomre instability, of linear fluctuations in an isolated, uniform, rotating disc. There, instability is characterized by a Q parameter below unity, and lower when the disc is thick. Instead, the high-redshift discs are highly perturbed. Over long periods they consist of non-linear perturbations, compact massive clumps and extended structures, with new clumps forming in interclump regions. This is while the galaxy is subject to frequent external perturbances. We compute the local, two-component Q parameter for gas and stars, smoothed on a ∼1 kpc scale to capture clumps of 108–9 M⊙. The Q \&lt; 1 regions are confined to collapsed clumps due to the high surface density there, while the interclump regions show Q significantly higher than unity. Tracing the clumps back to their relatively smooth Lagrangian patches, we find that Q prior to clump formation typically ranges from unity to a few. This is unlike the expectations from standard Toomre instability. We discuss possible mechanisms for high-Q clump formation, e.g. rapid turbulence decay leading to small clumps that grow by mergers, non-axisymmetric instability, or clump formation induced by non-linear perturbations in the disc. Alternatively, the high-Q non-linear VDI may be stimulated by the external perturbations such as mergers and counter-rotating streams. The high Q may represent excessive compressive modes of turbulence, possibly induced by tidal interactions.},
